# truth_table_generator

This is a truth table generator for logical expressions in propositional logic, built from scratch. As of now, it includes a lexer, an LL(1) parser, and a truth value permutation generator for propositions (in `TruthTable`).
It is still a work-in-progress, as the only thing one can do with the ASTs produced by the parser is to "pretty print" it, but I'm excited to continue building it.

(an example of the above is:)
```java
Token[] tokens = BooleanLogicLexer.tokenize("A->B|C");
BooleanLogicParser parser = new BooleanLogicParser(tokens);
Expr ast = parser.parse();
ExprPrinter.printExpr(ast);
// Output (polish notation): (or (then A B) C)
```

The sole purpose of this project is to learn about lexing, recursive descent parsing, formal grammars (also BNF/EBNF) and [Vim motions](https://vim.rtorr.com/).

The grammar for the parser is:
```ebnf
<formula>     ::= <term>
<term>        ::= <binary_op> <op_symbol> <term> | <binary_op>
<binary_op>   ::= <unary_op> (<op_symbol> <unary_op>)*
<unary_op>    ::= "!" <unary_op> | <proposition>
<op_symbol>   ::= "|" | "&" | "->" | "<->" | "^"
<proposition> ::= ([0-9] | [a-z] | [A-Z] | "_")+ | "(" <term> ")"
```
I'd like to thank [Paul Kline](https://github.com/paul-kline) for his excelent website: [BNF Playground](https://bnfplayground.pauliankline.com/), where I could develop and test what now is the definitive grammar for the parser.
To fiddle with the grammar or generate sample formulae, you can use this link to [Paul's BNF Playground](https://bnfplayground.pauliankline.com/?bnf=%3Cformula%3E%20%20%20%20%20%3A%3A%3D%20%3Cterm%3E%0A%3Cterm%3E%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%3A%3A%3D%20%3Cbinary_op%3E%20%3Cop_symbol%3E%20%3Cterm%3E%20%7C%20%3Cbinary_op%3E%0A%3Cbinary_op%3E%20%20%20%3A%3A%3D%20%3Cunary_op%3E%20(%3Cop_symbol%3E%20%3Cunary_op%3E)*%0A%3Cunary_op%3E%20%20%20%20%3A%3A%3D%20%22!%22%20%3Cunary_op%3E%20%7C%20%3Cproposition%3E%0A%3Cop_symbol%3E%20%20%20%3A%3A%3D%20%22%7C%22%20%7C%20%22%26%22%20%7C%20%22-%3E%22%20%7C%20%22%3C-%3E%22%20%7C%20%22%5E%22%0A%3Cproposition%3E%20%3A%3A%3D%20(%5B0-9%5D%20%7C%20%5Ba-z%5D%20%7C%20%5BA-Z%5D%20%7C%20%22_%22)%2B%20%7C%20%22(%22%20%3Cterm%3E%20%22)%22%0A&name=Logic%20CFG), where the grammar is ready to be compiled and tested.

## Roadmap

- Next, I'll build the interpreter for the ASTs generated by the parser.
- After that, I'm looking to build a web page that exposes the functionality of the truth table generator in a user-friendly way.
